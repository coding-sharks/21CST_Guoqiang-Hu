Production First and Production Ready End-to-End Keyword Spotting Toolkit.

The goal of this toolkit it to...

Small footprint keyword spotting (KWS), or specifically wake-up word (WuW) detection is a typical and important module in internet of things (IoT) devices.  It provides a way for users to control IoT devices with a hands-free experience. A WuW detection system usually runs locally and persistently on IoT devices, which requires low consumptional power, less model parameters, low computational comlexity and to detect predefined keyword in a streaming way, i.e., requires low latency.


## Typical Scenario

We are going to support the following typical applications of wakeup word:

* Single wake-up word
* Multiple wake-up words
* Customizable wake-up word
* Personalized wake-up word, i.e. combination of wake-up word detection and voiceprint
